Hi Rich,

Hey thanks for putting up our code for others to use.

Can you please contact me at: duncan.mccormack@adrock.com

... IF you need to further discuss removing all the License and readme guff.  Essentially, I give you permission to remove all that stuff (our license info in all the .PAS files) - and perhaps replace it with your LICENSE text (making it MIT license).

I'd like to make it all easier and more opensource and free.

Cheers,  Duncan.
