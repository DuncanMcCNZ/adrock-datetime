Delphi Adrock DateTime Suite

This is the excellent datetime suite for Delphi from Adrock software. It was originally commercial software but was released under the MIT license. See: http://www.adrock.com/Products/DelphiComponents.aspx

Certainly works for Delphi 7. If I upgrade for later Delphi versions these will be tagged.
